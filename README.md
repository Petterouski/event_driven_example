# Event-Driven example

The Event-Driven pattern is based on asynchronous communication between components through events. A component emits an event, and other components react to that event.

This pattern is useful in applications that require asynchronous processing, such as notifications, work queues or real-time systems.

This program implements a simple event system with a producer and a consumer.

## Execution
1. Install Python 3.x.
Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the producer:
 ````bash
 python event_producer.py
